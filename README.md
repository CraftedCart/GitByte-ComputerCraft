# Gitter - Github client for ComputerCraft
Hello there! This is the code repository for CraftedCart's Gtihub client for the Minecraft mod ComputerCraft

**This is the dev branch, meaning stuff is under development and you're likley to find tonnes of bugs, incomplete features, and items only accessible by modifying the code**

Feel free to contribute. Fork this project and send a pull request when you're done. Please detail what changes you've done and documenting your code would be much appreciated

You may find some tasks todo with `TODO:` written in a comment in the code
I recommend using the Sublime Text plugin TodoReview to find and list these

I do try to document my code, however if you aren't sure about what a certain aspect does, feel free to submit an issue

Found a bug, got a suggestion or something else? Submit an issue!
